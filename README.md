## The Pacman Project

![logo Pacman](https://pacman.com/images/games/pacman/pic_mv.jpg)

Our first semester school project consisted of making the well known [Pacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) game using C language and school provided tools.

### Description

We were told to create the original Pacman, the iconic arcade game.

We were given a periode of a month to work on the project using :

- C language
- "Libgraphique" graphics library
- "Makefile" to complile the code

We had to chose from three different diffuclty levels :

- Basic level
- Real time : ghosts pursue pacman even if he doesn't move
- AI : different behavior for each ghost

Due to the constrait of time and some technical difficulties, I only achieved the basic level.

### Installation

There is no installation needed.
After downloading the file :

- Decompress the file
- Install the graphics library package
- Open the terminal
- Type the following commands

```
cd /Downloads/Pacman
make ./resultat data/officiel.txt
```

### Usage

You can use the arrow keys or ZQSD keys to move Pacman.

##### Features

- Pacman movement and teleportation
- Pacman can eat pacballs, super pacballs and ghosts
- Ghosts movement and their behavior changes
- Ghosts can't go backward
- Map changes when Pacman eats pacballs, super pacballs and ghosts
